# CodeFunDo Ideas
# Pre-disaster Management
1. We plan to keep updated with the current situation and give warnings about disaster by taking input from the government/ international organisations. Also suggesting how to get prepared for the worst.

2. We plan to give the users information regarding how much their city is safe by analyzing their drainage system (say for floods) and what all steps can be taken in case of disasters. With such informations we can also give the government some recommendations about the city on how can they be better prepared. The information can be crowdsourced or can be collected form concerned agencies.

3. We plan to provide the users a platform through which they can meet their family members if they have separated. For this families register during pre-disaster period by uploading their family member pictures and other details in order to identify in future if at all required.

# Post-disaster Management
1. We will use crowdsourcing to gather information about the emergency camps, safety areas in and around the disaster affected area.

2. Users update their current status, and their saftey status, etc. The user can say that they are in emergency, if they are in. This information can be used by government/disaster management teams to prioritize their work and to effectively manage the situation. 

3. Users get the information about what steps they have to take, we can give suggestions to tackle/handle their situation effectively. We can also connect with the experts, medical teams. We can give information about nearest camps, etc.

4. People willing to help through any means will also be able to register through the app and connect with those in need of it.

5. Further we plan to use clustering algorithm to recommend the emergency camp setup in and around the city so that it should be able to help people in need.The basic idea is we will decide some threshold like if let say 100 people have requested for help and the nearest emergency camp showing is at 20km distance or more then we would run some clustering algorithm to cluster the users(on this database)the users(basically input to clustering will be lat-long of users) and based on such clusters (say k clusters) will recommend the already existing camps to setup the camps in these k locations.

6. If time permits and have sufficient datasets we would like to train deep-nets to recognize the child given the parents image and photos taken in relief camp, disaster affected areas.
