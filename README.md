# Pre-disaster Management
1.We plan to provide the users a platform through which they can meet their family members if they have separated.This will be done by the families in pre-disaster period by uploading their family pics so that in future if ever such disaster happens they can get identified by the relief camps.

2.We also plan to give the users information regarding how much their city is safe by analyzing their drainage system and all and what all steps can be taken in case of disasters.With such informations we can also give the government some recommendations about the city on how can they be better prepared.

# Post-disaster Management
1.We will use crowdsourcing to gather information about the emergency camps in and around the city.

2.People willing to help will also be able to register.

3.Further we plan to use clustering algorithm to recommend the emergency camp setup in and around the city so that it should be able to help people in need.

4.If time permits and have sufficient datasets we would like train deep-net to recognize the child given the parents.
