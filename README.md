# Ideas for Disaster Management

## Pre-Disaster Management

1. We plan to keep updated with the current situation and give warnings about disaster by taking input from the government/ international organizations. Also suggesting how to get prepared for the worst.

2. We plan to give the users information regarding how much their city is safe by analyzing their drainage system (say for floods) and what all steps can be taken in case of disasters. With such information, we can also give the government some recommendations about the city on how can they be better prepared. This data will be crowdsourced or will be obtained from concerned agencies.

3. We plan to provide the users a platform through which they can meet their family members if they have separated. For this families register during the pre-disaster period by uploading their family member pictures and other details to identify in future if at all required.

## Post-Disaster Management

1. We will use crowdsourcing to gather information about the emergency camps, safety areas in and around the disaster-affected area.

2. Users update their current status, and their safety status, etc. The user can say that they are in an emergency along with a priority score. This information can be used by government/disaster management teams to prioritize their work and to effectively manage the situation.

3. Users get the information about what steps they have to take; we can give suggestions to tackle/handle their situation effectively. We can also connect with the experts, medical teams. We can provide information about the nearest camps, etc.

4. People willing to help through any means will also be able to register through the app and connect with those in need of it.

5. Further, we plan to use a clustering algorithm to recommend the emergency camp set up in and around the city so that it should be able to help people in need. Let say 100 people have requested for help, and the nearest emergency camp is at the 20km distance or more. Then we will run a clustering algorithm to cluster the people (input will be current location) and based on clusters (say k in number) we will recommend the existing camps or else to set up the new camps in these k locations.

6. If time permits and have sufficient datasets, we would like to train deep-nets to recognize the child given the parents image and photos (or the other way round) taken in the relief camps, disaster-affected areas. It can be done by searching on photos taken or reconstructing the face of required person.
